# School_District_Analysis

## Overview 
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze standardized test data results to provide insights on performance trends and patterns. This analysis will be used to make informed and strategic decisions. The two data sets used can be found in the resources folder: "schools complete" and "students complete. These data sets contain information on school budgets, student test scores, grade levels, etc.

### Background
The analysis was performed twice due to discrepancies in information and changes made to the data. The school board suspects academic dishonesty, in the second analysis those scores which are under question have been changed to "NaN". In this report I will discuss how the changes made to the data affected the overall analysis.

## Summary
Altering the original data affected our results. We saw a decrease in test score percentaged for several metrics
